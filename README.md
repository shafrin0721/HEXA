## 🌿 Git Workflow

We follow a **feature-based branching strategy**:

1. Each member works on their own branch
2. No direct commits to `main`
3. Push changes to feature branch
4. Create Pull Request
5. Review and merge into `main`

### Branch Naming Convention

```bash
feature/<api-name>
```

Example:

```bash
feature/auth-api
feature/product-api
```
